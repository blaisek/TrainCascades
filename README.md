1. Put your positive images in the `./positive_images` folder and create a list
	of them:

        find ./positive_images -iname "*.jpg" > positives.txt

2. Put the negative images in the `./negative_images` folder and create a list of them:

        find ./negative_images -iname "*.jpg" > negatives.txt

3. Create positive samples with the `bin/createsamples.pl` script and save them
to the `./samples` folder:

        perl bin/createsamples.pl positives.txt negatives.txt samples 1500\
          "opencv_createsamples -bgcolor 0 -bgthresh 0 -maxxangle 1.1\
          -maxyangle 1.1 maxzangle 0.5 -maxidev 40 -w 80 -h 40"

4. Use `tools/mergevec.py` to merge the samples in `./samples` into one file:

        python ./tools/mergevec.py -v samples/ -o samples.vec

   Note: If you get the error `struct.error: unpack requires a string argument of length 12`
   then go into your **samples** directory and delete all files of length 0.

5. Start training the classifier with `opencv_traincascade`, which comes with
OpenCV, and save the results to `./classifier`:

        opencv_traincascade -data classifier -vec samples.vec -bg negatives.txt\
          -numStages 20 -minHitRate 0.999 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.5 -numPos 1000\
          -numNeg 600 -w 80 -h 40 -mode ALL -precalcValBufSize 1024\
          -precalcIdxBufSize 1024
          
    If you want to train it faster, configure feature type option with LBP:

         opencv_traincascade -data classifier -vec samples.vec -bg negatives.txt\
          -numStages 20 -minHitRate 0.999 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.5 -numPos 1000\
          -numNeg 600 -w 80 -h 40 -mode ALL -precalcValBufSize 1024\
          -precalcIdxBufSize 1024 -featureType LBP

    After starting the training program it will print back its parameters and then start training. Each stage will print out some analysis as it is trained:

      ```

      ```

    Each row represents a feature that is being trained and contains some output about its HitRatio and FalseAlarm ratio. If a training stage only selects a few features (e.g. N = 2) then its possible something is wrong with your training data.

    At the end of each stage the classifier is saved to a file and the process can be stopped and restarted. This is useful if you are tweaking a machine/settings to optimize training speed.

6. Wait until the process is finished (which takes a long time — a couple of days probably, depending on the computer you have and how big your images are).

7. Use your finished classifier!
